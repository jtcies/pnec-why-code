## I believe ...

1. We have the power to critically examine and improve our organizations and advance their missions

2. The way we currently do data analysis hinders this

3. Writing code can help

## A story

### 30 reports, 1000 lines of code, and lots of google later

##

<div class="centered">
<img src="xkcd.png" width = "750"/>
</div>

## Four local tables

1. Characteristics
2. Activity
3. Test scores
4. Outcomes

Allows me to do any analysis I need and not rely on specific reports

## Characteristics

## Activity

## Test scores

## Outcomes

## Tidy data


# So ... where do I start?

## Languages

<div class="centered">
### SQL 

and 

### Python or R
</div>

## Resources

### Always Google
